# Black Jack python

## Summary
This is a Casino-Style Blackjack Game written in Python. The purpose of this project is to serve multiple goals, including learning Python, creating a game I enjoy, practicing blackjack counting skills, and ultimately developing a web version with a user interface.

## Project Goals
1. **Learn Python**: Enhance my Python programming skills by building a complete project from scratch.
2. **Create a Fun Game**: Develop a Casino-Style Blackjack game that I enjoy playing.
3. **Blackjack Counting Skills**: Improve my blackjack counting skills by implementing and practicing various counting techniques within the game.
4. **Web Version with UI**: Transition the game from a command-line interface to a web-based application with an intuitive user interface.

It is still work in progress with some missing functions and a few bugs.

## Prerequisites before you can play
**Python3:** (my version is Python 3.9.6), More info about download can be 
found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).   
  
**PIP:** If you're using Python 3.4 (or greater), then PIP comes installed 
with Python by default. If you're not, then read how to do 
[here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/).  

Clone or download the repo to your local machine. 

From a shell *(linux shell, windows command or Git bash)* first make sure you 
are in the project root of *blackjack* and type:   
`python blackjack.py` or `python3 blackjack.py` 

The game should now fire up. Please enjoy!
