# Black Jack python

**Summary**
This is a Casino-Style Blackjack Game written in python

The purpose of this project has been to learn python and 
documentation of python code.

It is still work in progress with some missing functions and a few bugs.

### Prerequisites before you can play
**Python3:** (my version is Python 3.9.6), More info about download can be 
found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).   
  
**PIP:** If you're using Python 3.4 (or greater), then PIP comes installed 
with Python by default. If you're not, then read how to do 
[here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/).  

Clone or download the repo to your local machine. 

From a shell *(linux shell, windows command or Git bash)* first make sure you 
are in the project root of *blackjack* and type:   
`python blackjack.py` or `python3 blackjack.py` 

The game should now fire up. Please enjoy!
